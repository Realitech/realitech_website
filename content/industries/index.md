## Retail - Omni Channel 
 Retail has awlays been very competitive and now is even more so with multi-channel, multi access from consumer purchases through to the supply chain and warehousing. Retail Organisations need to implement nimble systems that can react to change whilst ensuring potential sales are not missed when new markets or new sales channels are opened. 
 
While the retail landscape is filled with silver bullet tools Realitech is technology agnostic adopting a best of breed integrated api appraoch that support the evolution and integratoin of 

* often proven legacy systems
* on premiese and cloud ecommerce 
* traditional data stores with event driven nosql 
* social, marketing and chat 
* machine learning 
* revenue generating api's to create a collaborative sales network

This can then be used to help define Key Performance Indicators, Management Information (in real-time) and mapping trend analysis to both the consumer base and process interaction within key areas of the Retail operation. 
 
Realitech has worked some of the largest Retail Businesses to help them define: 
 
* Systems Architecture 
* Adoption of 'Best for Need' Technologies  
* Using Agile delivery to accelerate technology and systems adoption 
* Define Business needs and match Technology whether traditional Application or Open Source 
 
To help your organisation deliver a coordinated and OMNI channel access to your customers and enable sales to spread across new and social media Realitech can deliver a proven Api approach to help define your requirements and ensure all key sponsors within the organisation play an active part in delivering the new system.

## Government

Digital services offer tremendous potential for improved government services. However very few projects deliver on the hope (or hype). Despite high expenditure government projects face a number of unique challenges that need to be address to ensure realistic success:

* **scale** - governments are challenged to provide the highest possible access with the least burden to the citizens. As a non-technology driven enterprise they must also often launch these services at scale (the whole population) while adapting to the constant changes in politics, legal requirements and budget changes. Unlike the small startup that can adapt to feedback and grow organically. The government depts. are often under server scrutiny both internally and externally as well as legal obligations that can hamper the successful role out.

* **cost** the media will often criticise (rightly) government waste and the high cost of projects. However the constant mix of lowest bidder projects in a rapidly changing environment and with unique requirements is seldom the environment to delivery the highest value for expenditure.
* **coordination** all of the factors covered here including scale, legal challenges, security and costs means coordination is more vital and more difficult to be achieved.

* **data use**  national and regional government departments collect large amounts of data as part of the normal business operation. Including health records, highway accident, arrest reports to trade and Census statistics. This treasure trove of information has the
potential to revolutionise the way that governments do business. The reality of multiple formats, regional restrictions on data sharing, privacy and legal challenges all make the releasing the potential of the data collected one of the most frustrating challenges.


* **lag time** while much of the public have grown used to new technolgies with new say new phones released every year. The government  budgets, needs for public consultation and the ever changing conflicts in goals and solutions mean that there can be a considerable lag time before governments adopt new technologies. Some measurements have found it has been up to 15 years delay for technology adoption. This  delay can compound itself where technologies that were once cutting-edge are obsolete by the time they find their way into the hands of local officials and government employees. Leaving an almost immediate need for modernisation.

* **security** - individuals have the right to expect robust security and data protection. Providing robust security, monitoring and data protection are challenges for the leading high tech companies. The goals of providing robust security while maintaining ease of use


Partners and consultants from Realitech have worked a range of government departments and projects. From the Customs and Excise to the NHS and Dept. of Justice. Relalitech have worked strategically important projects and architecture. The risk reduction approach that validates assumptions and expectations have resulted in a number of low cost, high value successes from he government that have been replicated many times over.

## Media
![real time bidding](/images/real-time-bidding.jpg)

Media is one of the industries that has seen unprecedented rates of change. With the arrival of new media formats, modes of delivery and business models.

Realitech has worked with many of the leading UK and international media companies including Sky Tv, Disney, Liberty media and more. Working on projects for
* next generation advertising platforms integrating with leading advertising platforms including
  * Google DFS
  * Google DoubleClick
  * Openx

Integrating ad serves, real-time bidding (RTB), algorithmic advertising campaigns and business reporting.

* Rights management - Assets and rights compliance has become more complex as the number of platforms, formats and services have multiplied. Rights contracts have become similarly complex as well as has the requirements for auditing and reporting.

We have worked with the leading vendors to provide api driven and largely open source solutions providing cost effective strategies that allow new revenues today as well as integrate new solutions effectively as their use-case emerges.
