# OVERVIEW OF THE APPLICATOIN OF BLOCKCHAIN BY THE DUTCH CRIMINAL JUSTICE DEPT (JustID)  

In this paper we are happy to present a summary of the investigation in the use of bockchain by our Dutch collegues at Berenschot the leading providers of innovation to goverments and enterprise organisations.

### Participants

Jos Keulers, Project Manager, Criminal Record (JustID)
Peter Vermeulen, senior policy officer, Ministry of Security and
Justice department chain information
Dany Venema, chief strategic cluster Judicial information

## THE CASE: The criminal file
For the case is looked at first for a simple process in the
criminal justice. A suspect is arrested and interrogated by the police,
Then the suspect is brought by the Public Prosecutor at the
judge. In addition, the suspect has a lawyer who defended their rights.

# WHAT IS BLOCKCHAIN

A blockchain is a public or privately shared **ledger** that contains information on **every transaction** made using the blockchain.

A blockchain system is not based on trust but **cryptographic proof**. This allows two parties to create a mutual contract and have shared immutable proof.

Besides the cryptographic signature the other pillar of this technology is to have a ledger that can be shared and validated. There are a number of implementation that share the same underlying protocols.


## THE PILOT: HOW TO ENSURE EACH PARTY CONCERNED IN A LAWSUIT HAS THE SAME DOCUMENTS AVAILABLE (EQUALITY OF ARMS)
One of the goals of the Dutch Ministry of Security and Justice technology department JustID is to provide facilities for the
criminal justice.

As part of this service there is a duty to ensure all parties in a trial, prosecution and defense  have equal access to the documents provided for the case. For the justice system it is important that there are no errors or gaps in the distribution of documents that may cause costly delays or a miss-trial.

As part of this proof of concept how blockchain can be used for access of the various parties to the information by the criminal justice system including
* police report and evidence reports
* fingerprints records
* extracts of criminal records

As part of this assessment of the functioning of blockchain the team also considered the legal implications and the suitability of blockchain to operate within the existing legal frameworks


## RESULTS: YES FOR A TRACKING LEDGER BUT NOT A DOCUMENT STORE

As part of the proof of concept a number of advantages of blockchain were discovered
* Blockchain provides a robust means of tracking and auditing the exchange of information that is legally robust.
* The use of blockchain was considerably faster than many traditional and cumbersome approaches including the large number of documents that are faxed to provide an audit trail.
* the ability to manage the distribution also protected the rights to privacy of the people involved.
* The blockchain offers a solution for the registration and time-stamping of important documents. For example when the first official report of the police is shared with the Public Prosecutor (OM), is now a 'transaction' has taken place may be included in the block chain.
*  The audit can also be used as a  check to  whether changes have taken place in a document and with which parties these changes are shared.

Some lessons learned
* documents themselves are not suitable to include in the block chain. It was not a technical limitation but blockchain is a permeant storage and in the case of acquittal some records need to be erased. However it was considered suitable that only references to documents to be included in the block chain

 As a summary of this initial assessment  it certainly is feasible to use blockchain to enhance the speed and transparency of the existing legal process.  The block chain experts see possibilities, provided that all chain partners (police, justice, OM, court,
lawyers) access to internal private ledger .

#  A CLEAR DIRECTION FOR FRUITFUL INVESTIGAITON
Legal system security and privacy is always a concern and has often been difficult to implement and burdensome to use.
Blockchain's technology derived from the widely used and distributed bitcoin and crypto currency platforms has proved remarkably robust as well as simple enough for many parties to be involved and use.

As a result the adoption of blockchain as part of the distribution and ledger/audit system of the criminal justice gains in the benefits that blockchain has offered to many other industries from finance to supply chain and logistics.

The application of blockchain is the legal system is only at the beginning and is already been seen to have profound potential in contract law and legal management. It is hoped that it can also assist and modernise the often creaking criminal justice system to provide a better service to all engaged.

For JustID the pilot was the start of a further exploration. In the future JustID will include examining how the block chain processes can
support and improve within the criminal justice system.
