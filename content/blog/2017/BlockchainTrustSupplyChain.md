# Blockchain enabled Trust & Transparency in Global Supply Chains

## Overview

The global supply chains  are increasingly agile (just in time) opaque and complex. Modern products can span over hundreds of production stages and several geographical locations.

This introduces the risks of **fake** goods, fraud, theft, accidental loss and a high overhead of tracking and tracing.

The financial costs of fake, sub-standard goods produced perhaps by un-ethical means poses a grave risk to the major brands and can result in the loss of brand trust to the loss of life.

## Enter Blockchain - Hope or Hype

A blockchain is a public or privately shared **ledger** that contains information on **every transaction** made using the blockchain.

A blockchain system is not based on trust but **cryptographic proof**. This allows two parties to create a mutual contract and have shared immutable proof. This contract can take places without the need for a centralized institution such as a bank to broker the transaction.

Blockchain can be viewed as a gigantic google doc spreadsheet that represents a registry of assets and the history of all transactions f that asset. All parties can hold a copy of the distributed ledger which cannot be changed and can be audited by anyone.

The proposed advantages of blockchain in the supply chain is:
* **speed** and **cost** - no need for expensive third parties or centralised systems
* **transparency** the history of all transactions for the product or part can be traced
* **agility** new parties and new business models can be added more rapidly

**Letters of Credit**

In  trade between a buyer and seller in different countries, the most common used instrument is **Letter of Credit** (LC’s). This is a cumbersome process, costly with costs ranging around **2-4%** on annual basis, prone to error and involves a financial intermediary to process the transaction. The great advantage of LC’s is that payment is secure and guaranteed by the banks.

For some countries and parties, often the most disadvantaged,  they may not be able to access letters of credit.

**The Blockchain Alternative**

Wtih blockchain two parties agree to trade goods,
* the seller gets via his wallet the confirmation the buyer has sufficient funds and the criteria he needs to meet.
* When the goods are shipped, and the pre-defined criteria are met, the payment is executed.

The hope with blockchain is this way of financing a supply chain is  cheaper and more efficient than traditional approaches with greater transparency and ability to scale.
