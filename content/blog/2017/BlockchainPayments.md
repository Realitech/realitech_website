# Practical Blockchain Payments Plaforms - Oppertunities and Challenges

Many companies and even countries have been exploring Blockchain and open ledger technologies. There have been a number of **hyped** advantages and perhaps **hard won lessons** to implement practical blockchain implementations.

## The Opportunities for Payments


## The Challenges   

Public blockchain technologies do not offer scale and speed needed to achieve mass adoption for high volume use cases.   
However, a private, permissioned-based network built on blockchain technology can provide tremendous value to the payments industry.
The technologies are immature and their ability to support the challenging needs of the business has yet to be proved. My opinion is that it will be between 3 and 5 years before there is substantial adoption and impact on payments costs and revenues.
Blockchain technology can be deployed within existing payment processing models.
The current industry focus on the move to real-time payments and hence on the clearing process in payments will drive interest in these new technologies.
