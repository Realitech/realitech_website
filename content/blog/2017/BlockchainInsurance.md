# Blockchain Insurance - Evolution or Revolution

## Overview
As a consultancy we have seen various media clients in music bear the brunt (mp3s, kazza, spotify) of the digital revolution with the same effects rippling out to video and tv and new arrivals of Netfix and Amazon start the disruption.

Similarly in the financial world payment operators and 'alternative loan' providers are seeking to up turn the markets and insurance will follow accordingly.

The Insurance business in the minds of the consumer has hardly changed. The long forms are now filled in online and the processing and claims are long, tedious and often have a low level of transparency and trust .

At the time of writing in the UK I'm not aware of a popular insurance app, that provides instant quotes for fine grain insurance products based on data profiles with sophisticated offers based on time/availability and other factors.

This is in part due to the high overhead of developing and managing insurance products but is this all about to change.

# What is the Blockchain

A blockchain is a public or privately shared **ledger** that contains information on **every transaction** made using the blockchain.

A blockchain system is not based on trust but **cryptographic proof**. This allows two parties to create a mutual contract and have shared immutable proof.

Besides the cryptographic signature the other pillar of this technology is to have a ledger that can be shared and validated.

#1 - Insurance costs too much

Too much premium is lost in the processing chain through operational overhead in the form of multiple handoffs, manual processing and duplicated effort. Due to the legal nature of the contracts there need for compliance, due-process and tracking have traditionally slowed the process with multiple manual checks.

This frictional cost of doing business is the opportunity that blockchain will exploit. For what it's worth PwC forecast operational savings of **$5-10bn** in reinsurance alone.

# 2- Insurance is a Business of Trust

Insurance has a basis of trust that that they will be there when needed. As insurance companies have scaled out they have become legalistic and bureaucratic.

For now many people only opt of a *must have* insurance for death and travel and where mandated by law.    

Blockchain offers the option of smaller, simplified *Smart Contracts* that are clearer in content and commitments and can be more easily tailored to the individual requirements without large amounts of legalize.

# 3 Insurance is too Slow

In the age of instant gratification and on demand cars, music, food the speed of an insurance quote or worse a claim starts to feel glacial.

Blockchain promises (hypoe?) is to reduce transaction times and remove this settlement latency from the value chain. A key delay in due to the need for the customer to **prove thier honesty**. The opportunity with the blockchain is that in many insurance domains e.g supply chain, they customer can append their actions to the blockchain to provide proof of actions. This leads naturally to the next point, improved transparency.

# 4 - Insurance is not transparent

As part of the trust discussion the transparency of what is covered by any insurance policty has become opaque shroweded in legal boilerplate. The situation worsens in wholesale markets. Multiple parties, manual operations, duplicate processes all lead to a lack of transparency in the insurance value-chain.

The insurance model is more equivalent to a car rental where when you book to 'hold a car' does not mean that the car will actually be there. And there is a frustration transfer of responsibility to refuel, insurance and manage the car.

Enter Uber and your now paying per trip and the transaction is simple and instant.

The opportunity for blockchain insurance is to provide the same level of instant and clear transaction. The risk for the insurance industry is that it also opens to market for disruptive **peer-to-peer** incumbents without so much legacy friction.

# Innovate before being Disrupted

Like other industries before music, video, taxi's and financing insurance is not immune to being disrupted by the right combinations of technologies and new business models.

 Blockchain offers the opportunity to the right company to re-new the insurance relationship and expand into a host of new business and geographical markets. The ability to have low cost, fast, granular insurance instantly can restore the peace of mind that insurance can provide as well as direct the fees to managing risk and payments and less for long and tedious delivery chains. The future is already here .. it is just not widely recognized yet
